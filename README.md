#Description of the project

The Local” app is made to assist you in your travel journey’s just as if you were to know someone who is a local in that city. “The Local” will cover 3 main topics that are essential to your travel experience. The first of these will be a dynamic map that will show you as a traveler what places to check out, all in comparison to your current location on the map. Next it will always keep you up to date with the current weather of the location that you are presently in or looking to travel to. Lastly but most importantly upon your search the local will send you back some popular cuisine from the area that you are in making it easy for you to figure out what should be ordered in a restaurant or bar setting of your desired location.
